[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find/usr/include/opencv4.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "/usr/include/opencv4", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "/usr/include/opencv4" with any of the following names:

    /usr/include/opencv4Config.cmake
    /usr/include/opencv4-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "/usr/include/opencv4" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "/usr/include/opencv4_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "/usr/include/opencv4" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
